# YearBook
The YearBook has always been on the top place on the Graduating batch's bucket list. Not only does it allow them to relive there four years but, it also gives them an opportunity to reconnect with all the people they have met in the campus. With great excitement, We have decided to make the yearbook, for colleges that doesn't have the concept of YearBook. 

## Components
This is a complete FOSS project, which means that it includes the backend as well as the frontend for creation of this service. Although, we do not want to restrict the utility of this apptication to a certain form of product. Hence, we have created an independent REST API backend which can be used with any frontend. Colleges or Universities, can use the api and make the frontend of the service as per their desire.

Consequently, any issues, pull requests etc. related to the backend API must have the label `api` and the issues, pull requests etc. related to any form of graphical frontend must have the `gui` label.

### API
The API is hosted on AWS Lambda. The code (and `README`) for the same can be found in the `api`.

### GUI
As of now (May 2021), there is no work done on the frontend. Please feel free to fork this repository, add a new folder for a new frontend, like `android`, or `web`, to start building such a GUI for end-users to be able to fully utilize this program.
